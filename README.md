# U-Shaped Bracket Design - Onshape Project

## 🔧 Project Overview
This project is a 3D model of a **U-shaped bracket** designed using **Onshape**. The bracket contains multiple circular holes and filleted edges for structural and functional purposes. The model is suitable for mechanical assemblies where mounting and support are needed.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- ✅ **Software**: Onshape (cloud-based CAD)
- ✅ **Main Tools**:
  - Sketch
  - Extrude
  - Fillet
  - Hole features

## 🧩 Design Features

### 1. **Base**
- A flat rectangular base.
- Contains **four circular holes** symmetrically distributed.
- Created using **Sketch 2** and **Extrude 2**.

### 2. **Side Arms**
- Two vertical side parts extruded from the sides of the base.
- Created using **Sketch 3, Sketch 4** and **Extrude 3, Extrude 4**.

### 3. **Top Holes**
- Each side arm includes a **circular hole**.
- Used for mounting or axis insertion.

### 4. **Fillets**
- **Fillet 1 & Fillet 2** were used to round inner edges for a smoother transition and better strength distribution.

## 🧭 Planes Used
- `Front`, `Right`, and `Top` planes were used to ensure the design is centered and symmetrical.

---

## 💡 Notes
- All dimensions were kept symmetric and referenced from the origin for parametric control.
- The design ensures both **structural integrity** and **easy manufacturability**.

---

## 📁 File Structure
- `Part Studio 1`: Includes all sketches and extrusions.
- `Assembly 1`: Not used (optional for future mounting).
